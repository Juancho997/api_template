# api_template
A simple API REST with integrated documentation and testing.

1. First of all, create a database based in mySQL.
2. Use the .env.example as a guide to configurate the environment variables.
3. NPM I ==> NPM RUN DEV to start.

You can access the documentation @ http://localhost:3000/api-docs/ (if running in that port)
